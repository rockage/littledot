### Introduction

- As we all know, a basic HiFi set for digital audio system consists of the sound source, DAC, and amplifier. Besides sound source, users have to buy a DAC and amplifier, which means not only it costs more, and a lot of effort to find the right match.

  LD-ZERO is an all-in-one unit, which is a simple plug n’ play system. We’ve picked “ZERO” as our model number for this unit, and it means “0 requirement.” You can instantly experience the carefully tuned and complete HiFi system with LD-Zero, thus truly achieving “out-of-the-box” experience.

  We hope LD-Zero accompanies you to sail you off on your HiFi journey. 

- LD-ZERO is equipped with a pair of NOS (New Old Stock) 1K2 tubes from Beijing tube factory, which makes the tone become
  warm and delicate,  "digital sound" polished to gentle and natural.

- LD-ZERO is also compatible with some famou tubes such as 1T4, 1S5, CV784, etc., the choice is very rich, playability is very strong!

- In general, due to its special structure, the tube amps need to work under the AC mains. But this time, LD-ZERO pioneered to let rechargeable batteries can also power it, so that the "portable gallows" has become a reality, playability upgraded again!
