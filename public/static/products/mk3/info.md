### Introduction

- MK3 is a entire vacuum tube amplifier.It can both work as headphone amplifier and vacuum tube pre-amplifier. It's design with SEEP circuit frame. Input stage used GE5654 form GE™, and final output stage is 6H6π. This framework guaranteed both high-current to drive low resistance headphones and high voltage swing for high resistance headphones.

- MK3 is a long-life product in our product line, it is a classic design of SEEP circuit frame, and all the components in this circuit are famous and reliable. The volume control potentiometer from ALPS™,Japan. E-Cap as filter capacitors from RUBYCON™,Japan. Coupling capacitance from ERO™, Germany. Final stage output capacitors form CHIEMI-COM™,Germany and calibrating capacitors form WIMA™,Germany.
