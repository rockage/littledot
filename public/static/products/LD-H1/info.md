### Introduction

- LD-H1 is a tube-transistor combined fully balanced headphone amplifier. The front stage tube part is the famous NOS tube 6SN7 from SYLNAVIA™,USA. Back stage part is designed with entire discrete symmetrical Class-A circuit without any molectron. This circuit has better Instantaneous response speed and lower crossover distortion.

- LD-H1 has a compatible framework for both balanced and non-balanced system. The machine contained XLR balanced input/output ports and non-balanced RCA input and 6.35mm output.

- The design scheme LD-H1 is “double single channel”. From power supply to amplifier, every circuit unit is exactly independent to avoid crosstalk.
Famous BC E-Cap as filter capacitors from Philips™. M-cap EVO audio special-purpose coupling capacitance from Mundorf™, Germany.

- Combined framework keeps advantages form both tube and transistor. Especially it performs excellently when driving low resistance headphones. 

- As a balanced amplifier, LD-H1 contained 4 independent amplification units with own transformer supply. The current direction through each amplification unit is opposite. This scheme offsets the fluctuation of voltage, makes power supply more stable and reduces power supply internal resistance intermodulation. It affects the sound performance more clear and roomy. Classic style appearance with textured wooden cover.
