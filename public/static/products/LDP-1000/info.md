### Introduction

- This is the HiFi top purifying power supply, it convert the AC power to DC power, through the MCU composite waveform convert to the stable AC power at 50 or 60Hz.

  This is our third generation of power regenerator, and we’ve adopted SCALE™ IGBT method from Power Intergration. The LDP-1000 has the following functions, automatic recovery after over-current protection, which gives the regenerator more reliable than that of the previous generation products.

  It has the function of automatically stable the frequency and voltage, active energy compensation, over-current protection, automatic recovery. With this method, we can avoid the disadvantages of dynamic compression, supply our equipment with clean power and the background will be pitch black.

Note: Due to the weight of the power regenerator, it is very difficult for us to lower the price of this wonderful unit. However, if you’re not in a rush, ocean freight will be able to save you a lot of money. The downside of that is that we will not be able to provide you any tracking number, and it could take up to 40 days for your product to arrive.
