### Introduction

- Little Dot MK II uses the 6J1 pentode as the pre-amp tubes, and the double diode triode 6n6. This combination forms a SEPP (Single-Ended Push Pull) OTL Class-A amplifier. The SEPP circuit design greatly increases sound quality, dynamic range, output impedance, and lower distortion over the Little Dot II.
- The Little Dot MK II now also provides gain control of 3, 5, and 10 via internal DIP switches for fine-tuning so you can maximize synergy with almost any headphone you have, whether it be 32 ohms or 600! Not only it works great as a headphone amplifier, it also works as a pre-amplifier, and the user can link it to your power amplifier to tune your current system. The double anodic aluminum oxidation provides chassis quality touch and smooth surface.
- The Little Dot MK II also gives user to enjoy tube-rolling, you can stick with the original 6JI, or you could swap with WE403A/B, GE5654, M8100, CV4010, EF95, and etc. At its factory jumper setting, and with jumper pins shorted, EF92, CV131, and all equivalents and drop-in replacements!
